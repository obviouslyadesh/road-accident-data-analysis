# Prithvi Highway Accident Analysis & Predictive Model

This project is a large-scale data analytics and machine learning system designed to analyze and predict road accident severity along Nepal’s Prithvi Highway. The system combines machine learning, geospatial analysis, and API-based deployment to provide actionable insights into accident-prone highway sections and real-time accident risk assessment.

# Project Objectives

1. Analyze historical road accident data to identify high-risk patterns

2. Predict accident severity using machine learning

3. Map accident-prone locations specific to the Prithvi Highway

4. Provide real-time accident severity prediction through an API

5. Support data-driven road safety planning and risk mitigation

# Machine Learning & Analytics

1. Trained and optimized XGBoost models using 152,445 accident records

2. Achieved approximately 85% accuracy in accident severity prediction

3. Adapted Australian road accident datasets to Nepal’s highway conditions and geographic context

4. Performed extensive feature engineering and model evaluation to ensure generalization
